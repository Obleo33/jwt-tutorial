# Getting Started

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# copy configuration and replace with your own settings
cp .env.example .env

# Run
npm start
```

The npm start command uses webpack to compile the application code and run a simple server for the development environment. It also keeps watching for file changes, updating the browser tab properly.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
